around.

First, clone the git.

really, should be built.  So, make sure the libs are installed in
order to `make` is so.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev postgresql-server-dev-all
#+END_SRC

Change to the source directory and `make install`.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo make install

** ~CREATE EXTENSION migration~

Now the objects must be loaded into the database.
