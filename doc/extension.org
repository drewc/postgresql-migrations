This is our[fn:royalwe] first postgresql extension. Here be dragons.

* Introduction 

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/extend-extensions.html

"To be able to run the CREATE EXTENSION command in your database, your
extension needs at least two files: a control file in the format
extension_name.control, which tells Postgres some basics about your
extension, and a extensionâ€™s SQL script file in the format
extension--version.sql"

* Footnotes

[fn:royalwe] The royal we, or majestic plural (pluralis maiestatis), is the
use of a plural pronoun (or corresponding plural-inflected verb forms)
to refer to a single person holding a high office, such as a sovereign
monarch or religious leader like the Pope.
